### Hi there, my name is Ronald Solticzki

QA Manual Tester & Frontend Developer - JavaScript - React - HTML - CSS

<h2>How did it all start?</h2>

It all started with a Manual Testing course where we learned the basics of testing. I also learned the testing process and the steps to follow, I learned how to write test cases, test design, bug reports, SDLC.

Upon completion of the course, I started working with a frontend developer who, at that time, was building his portfolio, which includes 3 websites. 
Subsequently I was recruited by a company in Sicily, for a Manual Tester Internship position, part-time for 6 months.

Since my internship I developed a passion for Frontend, which I started to study.I started with a course on HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React on Udemy. I am currently deepening my knowledge for the above mentioned and will start my adventure by creating a portfolio website.
